This is an Android App that will search TVShows information and show the details of a selected show. 

It was made during a recruitment process, and it had the following objectives:
- REST API integration (TheMovieDB API);
- 1st screen: possibility of searching a tv show by the name. A list of the most popular tv shows is presented to the user before he realizes any search;
- 2nd: screen: information about the tv show that the user searched (name, overview, origin country, original language, number of seasons, keywords, and episodes filtered by season).

Known bugs:
-  In the 2nd screen, the episodes filtered by season are inconsistents. Sometimes, they do not appear, and when they appear, the user gets the episodes of the 1st season, in every other season.

I spent around 10 hours learning about the API and implementing it, and I will not continue this project.
